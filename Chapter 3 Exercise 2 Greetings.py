Friends = ["Aiman", "Basil", "Lateef"]
for x in Friends:
    print("Morning", x, "how was your weekend?")
#Again, I used the for loop to meet the requirements of the exercise.
#It’s almost the same code as the one of the first exercise but I added some comments when using the print function on the third line so that each person can get a specialized message for them.
#As opposed to just printing “Morning Aiman, Basil, and Lateef how were your guys’ weekends?”
