import datetime

#Just like on second exercise, I had the import information from my computer to visual studio for this code to work. 

#On the second line, I used “now” as a variable and I assigned it “datetime.datetime.now().” 

#After those 2 lines are formed, I can now print the current date and time in the terminal.
