#I split the sentence, “This sentence only makes sense when the variables are printed together” and split in 3 to give to each variable. 

#I thought of 2 ways to print this. I could print the 3 variables together like what I did in the fifth line or I could make a list comprising all 3 variables and print that list.
#I decided to print both to show the 2 ways that I could print the sentence together. Though the first option was the better option.
