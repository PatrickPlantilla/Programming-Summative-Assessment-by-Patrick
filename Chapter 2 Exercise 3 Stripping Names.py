#I assigned a name of a cartoon character to a variable and I put lots of spaces and “\t” and “\n” to make this exercise. 

#On the third line, I typed “print(“\n”)” to make a space on between the comments in the terminal. I will be doing this for quite a but in a lot of other exercises in the future. 

#On the fourth line, I used the “lstrip” command to strip the “\t” on the variable. 

#On the seventh line, I used the “rstrip” command to strip off the “\n” on the variable. 

#On the tenth line, I didn’t strip anything in particular so that it will strip off the spaces by default.
