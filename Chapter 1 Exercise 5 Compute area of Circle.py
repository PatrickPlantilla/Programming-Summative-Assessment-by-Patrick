#This one was a bit tricky for me.
#I forgot the formula for finding the area of a circle from it’s radius so I needed a little help from google.
# With the knowledge I had received, I just translated it into python code. 

#On the first line, I had to type in “import math” to get the exact number of pi.
#At first I just gave a variable “pi” 3.14 but I thought I wanted the number to be exact so I just typed “import math” to get the exact number of pi.
