#This one is probably the easiest code so far besides the ones where I just had to print the variable or message.  

#We have done this particular code many times before in the class so this one was pretty easy and almost second nature.  

#I had to change the age multiple times when testing the code to make sure itâ€™s right but I settles with 19 as that is my age.
