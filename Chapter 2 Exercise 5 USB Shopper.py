money = (50.00)
cost = (6.00)
x = (money / cost)
x1 = round(x)
print ("She can buy", x1, "amounts of USB sticks")
y = (x1 - cost)
print ("She has £", y, "left.")
#This exercise took me quite a bit to finally figure out. Assigning numbers to variables and using the print function were easy enough but the formula on the third line, fourth line, and sixth line took a bit to figure out.
#I used a calculator to verify of my formula was correct and it kept on being wrong.
#It took me a bit to figure out the correct formula and eventually the answers were correct even after changing the variables for “money” and “cost”.
