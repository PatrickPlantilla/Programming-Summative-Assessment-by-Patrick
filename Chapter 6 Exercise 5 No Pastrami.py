#Unfortunately, I was not able to meet the full requirements of this exercise as I explained it on the comment on the eighth line. 

#I just copied and pasted the contents of the “sandwich_orders” code list to the “finished_sandwiches” list and printed that. I did that so that it would still look fine in the terminal.
#Sadly, the code would not work in real life and did not work as intended by the exercise.
