#I followed the instructions that the exercise instructed me but instead of putting “Alice in Wonderland”, I put “Noli Me Tangere” instead. A very important book for Filipinos. 

#Also, this time I had to put “f” and  {title.title()} to make it so that it reads the name of the book on the third line and prints it in the terminal.
