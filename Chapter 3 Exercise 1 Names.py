Friends = ["Aiman", "Basil", "Lateef"]
for x in Friends:
    print(x)
print("\n")
print(Friends)
#To meet the requirements of the exercise, I used the for loop to print each friend individually in the list. You can also print the names by just printing the “Friends” variable but using for loop was better.
